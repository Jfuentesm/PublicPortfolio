<key concepts>
According to Daniel Schmachtenberger, the key difference between narrow boundary intelligence and wide boundary intelligence lies in their scope and goals:

**Narrow boundary intelligence** focuses on achieving specific, limited goals for a narrow set of stakeholders within a short timeframe, often optimizing for a small set of metrics while potentially externalizing harm to other aspects that also matter. It's primarily concerned with direct effectiveness at achieving immediate objectives without necessarily considering broader impacts.

**Wide boundary intelligence** considers a comprehensive range of stakeholders and impacts, including all people (present and future), all lifeforms, and multiple definitions of what is worthwhile beyond simple metrics like GDP. It takes into account long-term consequences and attempts to ensure that progress is genuinely beneficial across a whole scope rather than just in isolated metrics.

Schmachtenberger suggests that this distinction between narrow and wide boundary focus may represent a fundamental difference between intelligence and wisdom. He argues that humanity is pursuing "evolutionary cul-de-sacs" by optimizing for narrow goals and perceiving reality in a fragmented way, leading to models that may succeed in the short term but move toward comprehensively worse realities in the long run.

<dimensions of wide boundary intelligence>
Operationalizing wide-boundary intelligence in decision-making involves identifying its core dimensions and sub-dimensions, which can serve as a framework for evaluating and guiding decisions. Below is a deeper exploration of these dimensions, structured to make wide-boundary intelligence actionable.

---

## **Dimensions and Sub-Dimensions of Wide-Boundary Intelligence in Decision-Making**

### **1. Temporal Awareness**
Wide-boundary intelligence considers the full timeline of consequences, from immediate to long-term.

- **Short-Term Impacts**: Assessing the immediate effects of a decision on all stakeholders.
- **Long-Term Impacts**: Considering how the decision will ripple across time, including impacts on future generations.
- **Path Dependency**: Evaluating how the decision constrains or enables future choices (e.g., locking into certain technologies or systems).
- **Irreversibility**: Identifying actions that have permanent consequences and weighing them accordingly.

---

### **2. Spatial Awareness**
This dimension involves understanding how decisions affect not just local systems but also broader, interconnected systems.

- **Local Effects**: Direct impacts on the immediate environment or community.
- **Global Effects**: Broader implications for global systems (e.g., ecosystems, economies, geopolitics).
- **Systemic Interconnectivity**: Recognizing how changes in one part of a system can cascade into others (e.g., supply chains, ecological feedback loops).

---

### **3. Stakeholder Inclusion**
Wide-boundary intelligence requires considering the perspectives and needs of all affected parties.

- **Human Stakeholders**:
  - Direct stakeholders (e.g., employees, customers).
  - Indirect stakeholders (e.g., communities, future generations).
- **Non-Human Stakeholders**:
  - Ecosystems and biodiversity.
  - Non-sentient systems affected by human activity (e.g., climate systems).
- **Marginalized Voices**: Ensuring underrepresented groups are included in the decision-making process.

---

### **4. Ethical and Value Alignment**
Decisions must align with ethical principles and shared human values.

- **Moral Philosophy**:
  - Utilitarianism: Maximizing well-being for the greatest number.
  - Deontology: Adhering to universal principles or rights.
  - Virtue Ethics: Cultivating character and wisdom in decision-makers.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respecting diverse cultural values and norms.
- **Intergenerational Equity**: Balancing the needs of current and future generations.

---

### **5. Complexity and Systems Thinking**
Wide-boundary intelligence requires understanding complex systems and their dynamics.

- **Holistic Analysis**: Looking at the system as a whole rather than isolating parts.
- **Feedback Loops**:
  - Positive feedback loops (amplifying effects).
  - Negative feedback loops (stabilizing effects).
- **Emergent Properties**: Recognizing that systems can exhibit behaviors not predictable from their components.
- **Unintended Consequences**:
  - Anticipating second-order and third-order effects.
  - Mitigating risks from blind spots.

---

### **6. Knowledge Integration**
Incorporating diverse knowledge domains to inform decisions.

- **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: Drawing insights from multiple fields (e.g., ecology, economics, sociology).
- **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**: Relying on data and research while remaining open to uncertainty.
- **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledging the limits of oneâ€™s knowledge and seeking external expertise when needed.

---

### **7. Resilience and Adaptability**
Building flexibility into decisions to handle uncertainty and change.

- **Scenario Planning**: Preparing for multiple possible futures (e.g., best-case, worst-case scenarios).
- **Robustness**: Ensuring decisions hold up under a variety of conditions.
- **Flexibility**: Designing systems that can adapt to unforeseen changes or disruptions.

---

### **8. Psychological and Emotional Intelligence**
The mindset of the decision-maker plays a critical role in wide-boundary intelligence.

- **Empathy**:
  - Understanding the experiences of others (human and non-human).
  - Cultivating compassion for those impacted by decisions.
- **Cognitive Bias Awareness**:
  - Identifying biases like confirmation bias or short-termism that might distort judgment.
  - Implementing strategies to counteract these biases.
- **Emotional Regulation**:
  - Managing stress or fear that might lead to reactive or narrow thinking.
  - Cultivating calmness to engage with complexity effectively.
