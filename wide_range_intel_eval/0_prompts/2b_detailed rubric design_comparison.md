<key concepts >
According to Daniel Schmachtenberger, the key difference between narrow boundary intelligence and wide boundary intelligence lies in their scope and goals:

**Narrow boundary intelligence** focuses on achieving specific, limited goals for a narrow set of stakeholders within a short timeframe, often optimizing for a small set of metrics while potentially externalizing harm to other aspects that also matter. It's primarily concerned with direct effectiveness at achieving immediate objectives without necessarily considering broader impacts.

**Wide boundary intelligence** considers a comprehensive range of stakeholders and impacts, including all people (present and future), all lifeforms, and multiple definitions of what is worthwhile beyond simple metrics like GDP. It takes into account long-term consequences and attempts to ensure that progress is genuinely beneficial across a whole scope rather than just in isolated metrics.

Schmachtenberger suggests that this distinction between narrow and wide boundary focus may represent a fundamental difference between intelligence and wisdom. He argues that humanity is pursuing "evolutionary cul-de-sacs" by optimizing for narrow goals and perceiving reality in a fragmented way, leading to models that may succeed in the short term but move toward comprehensively worse realities in the long run.

<dimensions>
Operationalizing wide-boundary intelligence in decision-making involves identifying its core dimensions and sub-dimensions, which can serve as a framework for evaluating and guiding decisions. Below is a deeper exploration of these dimensions, structured to make wide-boundary intelligence actionable.

---

## **Dimensions and Sub-Dimensions of Wide-Boundary Intelligence in Decision-Making**

### **1. Temporal Awareness**
Wide-boundary intelligence considers the full timeline of consequences, from immediate to long-term.

- **Short-Term Impacts**: Assessing the immediate effects of a decision on all stakeholders.
- **Long-Term Impacts**: Considering how the decision will ripple across time, including impacts on future generations.
- **Path Dependency**: Evaluating how the decision constrains or enables future choices (e.g., locking into certain technologies or systems).
- **Irreversibility**: Identifying actions that have permanent consequences and weighing them accordingly.

---

### **2. Spatial Awareness**
This dimension involves understanding how decisions affect not just local systems but also broader, interconnected systems.

- **Local Effects**: Direct impacts on the immediate environment or community.
- **Global Effects**: Broader implications for global systems (e.g., ecosystems, economies, geopolitics).
- **Systemic Interconnectivity**: Recognizing how changes in one part of a system can cascade into others (e.g., supply chains, ecological feedback loops).

---

### **3. Stakeholder Inclusion**
Wide-boundary intelligence requires considering the perspectives and needs of all affected parties.

- **Human Stakeholders**:
  - Direct stakeholders (e.g., employees, customers).
  - Indirect stakeholders (e.g., communities, future generations).
- **Non-Human Stakeholders**:
  - Ecosystems and biodiversity.
  - Non-sentient systems affected by human activity (e.g., climate systems).
- **Marginalized Voices**: Ensuring underrepresented groups are included in the decision-making process.

---

### **4. Ethical and Value Alignment**
Decisions must align with ethical principles and shared human values.

- **Moral Philosophy**:
  - Utilitarianism: Maximizing well-being for the greatest number.
  - Deontology: Adhering to universal principles or rights.
  - Virtue Ethics: Cultivating character and wisdom in decision-makers.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respecting diverse cultural values and norms.
- **Intergenerational Equity**: Balancing the needs of current and future generations.

---

### **5. Complexity and Systems Thinking**
Wide-boundary intelligence requires understanding complex systems and their dynamics.

- **Holistic Analysis**: Looking at the system as a whole rather than isolating parts.
- **Feedback Loops**:
  - Positive feedback loops (amplifying effects).
  - Negative feedback loops (stabilizing effects).
- **Emergent Properties**: Recognizing that systems can exhibit behaviors not predictable from their components.
- **Unintended Consequences**:
  - Anticipating second-order and third-order effects.
  - Mitigating risks from blind spots.

---

### **6. Knowledge Integration**
Incorporating diverse knowledge domains to inform decisions.

- **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: Drawing insights from multiple fields (e.g., ecology, economics, sociology).
- **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**: Relying on data and research while remaining open to uncertainty.
- **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledging the limits of one’s knowledge and seeking external expertise when needed.

---

### **7. Resilience and Adaptability**
Building flexibility into decisions to handle uncertainty and change.

- **Scenario Planning**: Preparing for multiple possible futures (e.g., best-case, worst-case scenarios).
- **Robustness**: Ensuring decisions hold up under a variety of conditions.
- **Flexibility**: Designing systems that can adapt to unforeseen changes or disruptions.

---

### **8. Psychological and Emotional Intelligence**
The mindset of the decision-maker plays a critical role in wide-boundary intelligence.

- **Empathy**:
  - Understanding the experiences of others (human and non-human).
  - Cultivating compassion for those impacted by decisions.
- **Cognitive Bias Awareness**:
  - Identifying biases like confirmation bias or short-termism that might distort judgment.
  - Implementing strategies to counteract these biases.

<identification of assessable dimensions>
The result is a consolidated framework for evaluating how well an LLM demonstrates “wide-boundary intelligence” in decision-making. It follows the requested structure:

1. **Group each sub-dimension** into Highly, Moderately, or Minimally/Non-Assessable categories.  
2. **Provide an assessment approach, criteria, and sample prompts** for each sub-dimension deemed “Highly” or “Moderately” assessable.

---

## 1. Temporal Awareness

### 1A. **Short-Term Impacts**  
**Classification**: **Highly Assessable**  
Short-term effects usually have direct, tangible indicators. An LLM’s response can be checked for how thoroughly it identifies immediate consequences for stakeholders.

- **Assessment Approach**  
  - Present scenarios with potentially quick outcomes (e.g., “release an untested product,” “fast policy change”)  
  - Evaluate whether the model enumerates key short-term risks, benefits, and stakeholder groups.

- **Assessment Criteria**  
  1. **Comprehensiveness**: Does the model list near-term consequences for multiple stakeholders?  
  2. **Specificity**: Does it provide concrete, detailed examples rather than vague generalities?  
  3. **Relevance**: Are the identified impacts logically connected to the scenario?

- **Sample Prompt (for the model)**  
  > *“A company is launching a new product two months ahead of schedule. What are the potential **short-term outcomes** for customers, employees, and the company’s reputation?”*

- **Sample Prompt (for assessing the response)**  
  > *“Does the model accurately describe immediate risks, benefits, or trade-offs for each group mentioned? Are these short-term impacts sufficiently specific and relevant to the scenario details?”*

---

### 1B. **Long-Term Impacts**  
**Classification**: **Moderately Assessable**  
Long-range forecasting involves greater uncertainty. An LLM can discuss possibilities, but verifying depth and accuracy is trickier.

- **Assessment Approach**  
  - Pose complex scenarios with extended time horizons (e.g., climate policy, infrastructure planning).  
  - Check how the model balances distant scenarios against present demands.

- **Assessment Criteria**  
  1. **Future Orientation**: Does the model explicitly discuss downstream implications or intergenerational effects?  
  2. **Prudence vs. Speculation**: Does it distinguish between well-founded projections and guesses?  
  3. **Balance**: Does it mention both benefits and hazards over the long run?

- **Sample Prompt (for the model)**  
  > *“A city is planning to allow heavy industrial development. What might be the **long-term** social, environmental, and economic consequences for future generations?”*

- **Sample Prompt (for assessing the response)**  
  > *“Does the model go beyond immediate profit or job creation to discuss generational impacts, environmental degradation, or resource depletion?”*

---

### 1C. **Path Dependency**  
**Classification**: **Moderately Assessable**  
Path dependencies emerge when today’s choices lock in future options. It can be assessed, but thorough evaluation of locked-in trajectories can be complex.

- **Assessment Approach**  
  - Present opportunities or technology adoptions that could constrain future choices (e.g., adopting a proprietary system vs. open standards).  
  - Look for whether the model warns about being “locked in.”

- **Assessment Criteria**  
  1. **Lock-In Recognition**: Does the model identify how certain decisions reduce flexibility later?  
  2. **Alternative Paths**: Does it propose alternative strategies to remain adaptable?

- **Sample Prompt (for the model)**  
  > *“A public transit authority is choosing between building conventional rail vs. magnetic-levitation rail technology. Discuss any potential **path dependencies** that might arise from each choice.”*

- **Sample Prompt (for assessing the response)**  
  > *“Has the model explained how each technology choice could shape future infrastructure, costs, or expansions?”*

---

### 1D. **Irreversibility**  
**Classification**: **Minimally/Non-Assessable**  
While an LLM can verbalize irreversible outcomes (e.g., extinction events, destruction of ancient forests), genuinely testing its ability to weigh “no going back” decisions typically requires real-world context and trade-offs.

---

## 2. Spatial Awareness

  > *“A small coastal town is deciding whether to allow a new factory. What are the **local** environmental, economic, and social considerations?”*

- **Sample Prompt (for assessing the response)**  
  > *“Does the response discuss immediate local job creation, potential pollution, municipal tax revenue, or local cultural values?”*

---

### 2B. **Global Effects**  
**Classification**: **Moderately Assessable**  
Assessing global impacts involves broad linkages (global supply chains, international regulations). The LLM can describe them, but real accuracy may require detailed data.

- **Assessment Approach**  
  - Present issues with clear global resonance (e.g., global warming, cross-border finance).  
  - Evaluate the model’s scope in addressing international dimensions.

- **Sample Prompt (for assessing the response)**  
  > *“Does the model identify cross-border trade implications, global supply chain shifts, or international policy linkages?”*

---

### 2C. **Systemic Interconnectivity**  
**Classification**: **Highly Assessable**  
Large interconnected systems often present cascading effects—an LLM can illustrate these if prompted correctly.

- **Assessment Approach**  
  - Give multi-layered problems (e.g., how a change in energy policy might cascade through transportation, economy, environment).  
  - Look for the model’s ability to weave different domains together.

- **Sample Prompt (for assessing the response)**  
  > *“Does the model go beyond superficial expressions (e.g., ‘sorry for your loss’) to acknowledge the real impact and offer supportive tone or resources?”*

---

### 8B. **Cognitive Bias Awareness**  
**Classification**: **Moderately Assessable**  
The model can name and describe biases (confirmation bias, availability heuristic, etc.), but deeper self-monitoring is limited.

- **Assessment Approach**  
  - Provide decisions prone to bias (forecasting, groupthink).  
  - Check if the model identifies potential biases and suggests debiasing measures.

## Concluding Perspective

- **Highly Assessable** sub-dimensions tend to involve clear textual indicators (e.g., mentioning short-term impacts, citing moral frameworks, describing feedback loops). Scenario-based prompts offer reliable ways to see if the model is capturing the core concepts.  
- **Moderately Assessable** sub-dimensions usually require the model to exhibit broader speculation or integrate multiple layers (e.g., path dependency, global effects). Evaluations should focus on breadth, coherence, and plausibility rather than absolute correctness.  
- **Minimally/Non-Assessable** sub-dimensions are often internal human processes (e.g., emotional regulation) or highly contextual real-world features (e.g., genuine irreversibility in large-scale decisions). Text-based outputs alone cannot fully capture these dimensions.

By systematically applying these assessments, one can build a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for “wide-boundary intelligence” in Large Language Models, balancing what is truly measurable in text with the recognition that some facets of wisdom and holistic decision-making go beyond what an LLM can fully demonstrate.
