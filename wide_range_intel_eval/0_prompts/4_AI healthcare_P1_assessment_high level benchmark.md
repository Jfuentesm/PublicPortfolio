The system promises 95% accuracy in early disease detection across 50+ conditions, but requires extensive patient data sharing, costs $50M to implement, and will significantly impact current diagnostic workflows. The system's AI models were primarily trained on data from urban populations, and the vendor requires continuous data sharing for model updates.",
