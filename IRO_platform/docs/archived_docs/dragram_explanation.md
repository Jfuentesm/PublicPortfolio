## Diagram Explanation

1. **User and Perimeter Security**  
   - **Azure WAF** and **Azure Front Door (AFD)** handle inbound requests and protect against malicious traffic at the edge.  

2. **Security Layer**  
   - **Azure AD (AAD)** manages authentication and Single Sign-On, integrating with **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** for just-in-time administrator access.  
   - **Azure Key Vault** stores secrets, encryption keys, and certificates.  
   - **Azure Sentinel** provides SIEM/SOAR functionality for holistic threat detection and response.  

3. **Presentation Layer**  
   - **Django Web Interface** and **API Endpoints** form the system’s front end and integration points.  
   - **Authentication Portal** leverages Django’s built-in auth system, extended with Azure AD for enterprise SSO.  

4. **Application Layer**  
   - **Core Functionalities**:  
     - **Risk Inventory (RIM)**, **Risk Assessment (RAE)**, **Review Workflow System (RWS)**, **Sign-off Management (SOff)**, **Audit Trail Logger (ATL)**, **Reporting Engine (REP)**.  
   - **Enterprise Features**:  
     - **Multi-tenancy (MT)**, **RBAC**, **Data Segregation (DS)**, **API Gateway (APIG)** for integrations.  
   - **AI/ML Components**:  
     - **Risk Analytics (RiskAI)** (e.g., Azure ML), **Predictive Modeling (PredML)**, **Automated Decisioning (AutoML)**.  

5. **Data Layer**  
   - **Azure SQL DB** for structured data (risk inventories, user records).  
   - **Azure Cosmos DB** for unstructured data (large documents, logs, JSON-based risk events).  
   - **Azure Blob Storage** for file storage (e.g., logs, compliance evidence).  
   - **Disaster Recovery** with **Geo-Replicas** and **Azure Backup** ensures multi-region availability and minimal RPO/RTO.  

6. **Infrastructure Layer**  
   - **Django** deployed on **Azure App Service** or containerized in **AKS** for scalability.  
   - **Azure Monitor** for health metrics, logs, and alerts.  
   - **NSGs** and **Virtual Networks (VNet)** isolate traffic between tiers, restricting east-west movement.

## Key Implementation Details

- **Django as the Primary Framework**  
  Provides a robust ORM, built-in security features (CSRF, XSS protection), and a modular architecture for rapid development and future extensibility.

- **Azure Services**  
  - *Compute/Containers*: App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).  
  - *Data*: Azure SQL DB, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage.  
  - *Security*: Azure AD (Entra ID), Key Vault, Microsoft Sentinel, Azure WAF, NSGs.  
  - *Monitoring & DR*: Azure Monitor, Azure Backup, Geo-Replica.  

- **Security Implementations**  
  - Zero Trust boundary enforced via Azure WAF and Azure Front Door.  
  - All authentication and Authorization integrated with Azure AD and RBAC.  
  - Data encryption at rest using Azure SQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), Azure Storage Encryption, and Key Vault for key management.  
  - Network-level segmentation via VNets and NSGs.  

- **Data Flow Patterns**  
  1. User request hits WAF → AFD routes it to Django presentation layer.  
  2. AuthPortal or API checks credentials with Azure AD → returns tokens for user sessions.  
  3. The application layer interacts with Key Vault for secrets, with data layer for storing/fetching data, and calls Azure Monitor for logging/metrics.  
  4. AI/ML modules (RiskAI, PredML, AutoML) run advanced analytics for risk scoring or controls automation, storing intermediate results in Cosmos DB or SQL DB.  

- **Compliance & Enterprise-Grade Scalability**  
  - Follows Azure best practices for security, data privacy (GDPR), and multi-region deployments.  
  - Horizontal scaling via AKS or App Service enabling autoscaling during peak usage (e.g., audits, quarter-end risk reviews).  
  - Monitoring and logging solutions for real-time anomaly detection and mitigations via Azure Sentinel.
