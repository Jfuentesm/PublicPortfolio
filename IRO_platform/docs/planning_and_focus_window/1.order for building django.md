Based on the project structure and requirements, here's a recommended order for developing the files, focusing on establishing core functionality first and then building additional features:

1. **Core Configuration & Environment Setup**
```
1. requirements.txt         # Define initial dependencies
2. Dockerfile              # Container configuration
3. docker-compose.yml      # Service orchestration
4. .env                    # Environment variables
5. .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
```

2. **Django Project Foundation**
```
6. manage.py              # Django CLI utility
7. core/__init__.py       # Core package initialization
8. core/settings/base.py  # Base settings
9. core/settings/local.py # Local development settings
10. core/urls.py          # Main URL configuration
11. core/wsgi.py          # WSGI application entry
```

3. **Database & Schema Setup**
```
12. init-scripts/01-init-schemas.sql  # Database initialization
13. apps/common/models/base.py        # Base model classes
14. apps/common/middleware/tenant.py   # Multi-tenant middleware
```

4. **Core Applications**
```
15. apps/accounts/models.py           # User & tenant models
16. apps/accounts/views.py            # Authentication views
17. apps/accounts/urls.py             # Account URLs

18. apps/assessments/models.py        # IRO & assessment models
19. apps/assessments/views.py         # Assessment views
20. apps/assessments/urls.py          # Assessment URLs

21. apps/common/utils/                # Shared utilities
22. apps/common/validators/           # Custom validators
```

5. **API Layer**
```
23. apps/accounts/api/               # Account API endpoints
24. apps/assessments/api/            # Assessment API endpoints
25. apps/reporting/api/             # Reporting API endpoints
```

6. **Templates & Static Files**
```
26. templates/base.html             # Base template
27. templates/accounts/            # Account templates
28. templates/assessments/         # Assessment templates
29. templates/reporting/          # Reporting templates
30. static/css/                   # Stylesheets
31. static/js/                    # JavaScript files
```

7. **Background Tasks & Celery**
```
32. core/celery.py               # Celery configuration
33. apps/common/tasks.py         # Common background tasks
34. apps/reporting/tasks.py      # Report generation tasks
```

8. **Testing Infrastructure**
```
35. tests/conftest.py           # Test configuration
36. tests/accounts/            # Account tests
37. tests/assessments/        # Assessment tests
38. tests/reporting/         # Reporting tests
```

9. **Documentation**
```
39. docs/                    # Documentation directory
40. README.md               # Project documentation
```

This order ensures:
1. Basic infrastructure is in place first
2. Core functionality is implemented before additional features
3. Dependencies are properly managed
4. Testing can be done incrementally
5. Documentation evolves with the code

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this development sequence?
