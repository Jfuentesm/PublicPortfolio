**1. Epic Overview**  
The goal of this epic is to establish a **fully functional local development environment** using **Docker Compose** that mirrors the core infrastructure planned for AWS. This environment should replicate services such as the Django web application, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker, and any essential initialization scripts. By achieving near-parity with the eventual AWS deployment, the team can develop, test, and iterate locally with minimal friction when transitioning to the cloud.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. Running `docker-compose up` starts all services without error.  
  2. Django service is accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.  
  3. PostgreSQL and Redis containers are healthy based on Docker health checks.  
  4. Celery worker logs show successful connection to Redis (broker) and the database.  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - Docker Desktop or equivalent on Linux/Mac/Windows  
  - Existing Dockerfile for the Django and Celery containers  
  - Basic knowledge of Docker networking  
- **Story Points**: 3  
- **Priority**: High

### **LDE-2: Configure Django Settings for Local Development**

- **ID**: LDE-2  
- **Title**: *Local Django Configuration*  
- **Description**: Adjust `core/settings/local.py` and environment variables so that Django connects to the local Docker containers for database and Redis. Validate that the environment references `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and other local settings properly.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.local` is recognized.  
  2. Database migrations run successfully in the local container environment.  
  3. Redis is reachable from Django and Celery using environment variables.  
  4. Debug mode is enabled for local development.  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - Docker Compose environment from LDE-1  
  - django-environ or `dj_database_url` for environment variable parsing  
- **Story Points**: 2  
- **Priority**: High  

---


### **LDE-3: Database Initialization Scripts & Migration Verification**

- **ID**: LDE-3  
- **Title**: *PG Initialization & Migrating Schemas*  
- **Description**: Ensure the `/init-scripts` (e.g., `01-init-schemas.sql`) run automatically on container startup and that `manage.py migrate` functions without manual intervention. Validate multi-tenant setup logic if present.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. The `db` container automatically applies SQL scripts (e.g., `tenant_config` table creation).  
  2. `python manage.py migrate` completes without error on container start.  
  3. Tenants “test1” and “test2” are created per the sample script, verified in Django admin or psql.  
  4. No manual steps needed post `docker-compose up` for DB initialization.  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - PostgreSQL container health checks from Compose  
  - `manage.py` and the app’s migrations  
- **Story Points**: 3  
- **Priority**: High  

---
# NOT COMPLETE
### **LDE-4: Implement Gunicorn & Celery in Containers**

- **ID**: LDE-4  
- **Title**: *Production-like Service Commands*  
- **Description**: Update the Docker Compose service definitions to run Gunicorn for the Django web container and Celery worker for async tasks. Mirror the commands used for AWS deployment to ensure parity (e.g., Gunicorn command, Celery worker arguments).  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. Web container runs Gunicorn with accessible logs.  
  2. Celery worker container logs show normal queue listening.  
  3. Logging format matches or approximates production usage (JSON logs, or structured logs if required).  
  4. Both services remain stable under basic load testing.  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - Dockerfile references to `gunicorn` and `celery` installed via `requirements.txt`  
  - Properly configured environment variables (`CELERY_BROKER_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`)  
- **Story Points**: 3  
- **Priority**: Medium  

---

### **LDE-5: Set Up Python Debugging & Live Reload**

- **ID**: LDE-5  
- **Title**: *Developer-Friendly Debug Options*  
- **Description**: Add optional override commands in Docker Compose to run Django’s built-in development server (instead of Gunicorn) with live reload, if needed. This ensures efficient local debugging while preserving the production-like default.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. Developers can toggle a “dev mode” in Compose to run `python manage.py runserver`.  
  2. Code changes automatically reflect in the web container.  
  3. Gunicorn-based production command remains the default.  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - Docker volume mounting (for code changes)  
  - `django.conf` debug settings in local environment  
- **Story Points**: 2  
- **Priority**: Medium  

---

### **LDE-6: Automated Testing within the Compose Environment**

- **ID**: LDE-6  
- **Title**: *Containerized Test Runner*  
- **Description**: Configure a Compose service or ephemeral container to run tests (e.g., `python manage.py test`) against the local DB. This ensures QA can be done entirely within Docker.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. A dedicated `docker-compose test` target or script that spins up dependencies and runs all tests.  
  2. Test logs appear in the CLI, with exit status properly reported.  
  3. No need for separate environment outside of Docker to run the tests.  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - LDE-1 through LDE-3 must be complete (stable containers).  
  - A reasonably complete test suite in Django.  
- **Story Points**: 3  
- **Priority**: Medium  

---

### **LDE-7: Document Local Setup & Usage**

- **ID**: LDE-7  
- **Title**: *Local Environment Documentation*  
- **Description**: Provide comprehensive README or wiki instructions on how to start, stop, and troubleshoot the local environment. Include references to environment variables, how to run migrations, and test commands.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. A `README.md` or Confluence page covering local dev steps is published.  
  2. Instructions detail system requirements (Docker version, memory) and common errors.  
  3. Clear troubleshooting tips (e.g., how to reset DB volume, how to check container logs).  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - All prior tasks that define the final Compose configuration  
- **Story Points**: 2  
- **Priority**: Low  

---

### **LDE-8: Multi-Tenancy Validation in Local Env**

- **ID**: LDE-8  
- **Title**: *Local Multi-Tenant Simulation*  
- **Description**: Validate that tenant-specific database schemas or row-level security (depending on the design) function as expected in the Docker Compose environment. Confirm separation for tenants “test1” and “test2.”  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. Each tenant’s data is contained in a corresponding schema (or RLS policy).  
  2. The code that references `tenant_id` or schema-based routing works locally.  
  3. Tests verifying multi-tenant flows pass in the Docker environment.  
- **Technical Dependencies**:  
  - Must have the DB initialization scripts (LDE-3)  
  - The application’s multi-tenant logic must be tested.  
- **Story Points**: 5  
- **Priority**: Low  

---

**3. Technical Prerequisites**

- **Docker & Docker Compose**  
  - Ensure Docker Desktop or Docker Engine (version 20+).  
  - Docker Compose plugin v2.x or docker-compose v1.29+ installed.  
- **Python 3.11+** *(only if running local dev on host — not strictly needed if everything is containerized)*  
- **Access to the repository** containing the Django application, Dockerfiles, and Compose YAML files.  
- **Sufficient system resources**: Recommend at least 4 GB RAM allocated to Docker for stable multi-container usage.

**4. Development Environment Setup Guidelines**

1. **Check Out the Repo**  
   - Clone the project repository locally:
     ```bash
     git clone https://your-repo-url.git
     cd your-repo
     ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables (Optional)**  
   - Create a `.env` file or export variables in your shell (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `CELERY_BROKER_URL`) if needed.  
   - By default, the provided Docker Compose file may contain example environment variables.

3. **Build and Start the Environment**  
   - Run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose build
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - Wait for logs to show success messages (DB ready, migrations done, Django running).

4. **Accessing the Application**  
   - Open a browser at `http://localhost:8000/`.  
   - Verify the home page or any admin pages load successfully.

5. **Running Tests**  
   - Option 1: Use the dedicated Compose service (if configured), e.g.:
     ```bash
     docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py test
     ```
   - Option 2: Spin up a separate `test` service in `docker-compose.yaml`, if created.

6. **Viewing Logs and Debugging**  
   - Check container logs using:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs -f web
     docker-compose logs -f worker
     docker-compose logs -f db
     ```
   - Refer to the documentation in `README.md` for troubleshooting.

7. **Shutting Down**  
   - When finished:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```
   - Include `-v` if you wish to remove volumes (warning: this deletes DB data):
     ```bash
     docker-compose down -v
     ```

This sprint backlog and setup guide ensure the local development environment is robust, closely reflects the AWS structure, and supports debugging, testing, and multi-tenancy validation—all without diverging significantly from production configurations.
