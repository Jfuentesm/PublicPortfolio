## Notes & Special Considerations

1. **GDPR & SOC2**  
   - Ensure logging, data retention, and tenant data isolation satisfy these standards.  
   - Implement robust consent and data subject rights (GDPR “right to erasure” handling in archival flows).

2. **Tenant Isolation Patterns**  
   - Enforced at the database level (row-level security or separate schemas).  
   - Consider dedicated RDS for premium or high-compliance tenants.

3. **Scalability**  
   - RDS read replicas or vertical scaling for larger tenants if usage grows significantly.  
   - Evaluate CI/CD concurrency and environment provisioning for parallel deployments or testing.

4. **Backup & DR**  
   - Daily automated backups, monthly restore drills.  
   - S3 Glacier for archived tenant data.  
   - Document RPO/RTO and ensure business continuity strategy is tested.

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - Real-time dashboards, distributed tracing, and alert thresholds.  
   - Security logs integrated with GuardDuty and Security Hub to detect anomalies.

6. **Effort Sizing**  
   - “S” (Small): 2-5 days  
   - “M” (Medium): 1-2 weeks  
   - “L” (Large): 3-4+ weeks (or cross-team efforts)

7. **Priorities**  
   - **P0** = Highest urgency & critical for MVP/stability/compliance  
   - **P1** = Important, closely follows P0 for near-term delivery  
   - **P2** = Nice-to-have or future enhancement
