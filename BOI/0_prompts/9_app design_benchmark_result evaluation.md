## 4. Detailed Technical Component Diagrams (Text Summaries)

### 4.1 Data Flow Diagram

```
[Clients: Web & Mobile] -- (HTTPS/TLS) --> [API Gateway] --> [Microservices]
   - Authentication Service (Lambda)
   - Reporting Company (Fargate)
   - Beneficial Owner (Fargate)
   - Document Management (Lambda)
   - FinCEN Integration (Fargate)
             |
             v
          [Data Layer: RDS PostgreSQL, S3]
             |
             v
       [FinCEN External API]
```

1. **Clients** (Web & Mobile) communicate over secure HTTPS.  
2. **API Gateway** routes requests to different microservices.  
3. **Microservices** handle authentication, company info management, beneficial owner details, document processing, and external FinCEN filing.  
4. **Data Storage** uses encrypted RDS for relational data and S3 for document storage.  
5. **FinCEN API** is an external endpoint that receives sensitive BOI data submissions.

### 4.2 Deployment Diagram

```
[AWS Region]
  |
  |-- Route 53 (DNS)
  |-- CloudFront (CDN)
  |-- S3 (Static web assets)
  |
  |-- VPC
       |-- Public Subnets: Load Balancer, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host
       |-- Private App Subnets: API Gateway (private), Lambda, ECS/Fargate
       |-- Private Data Subnets: RDS PostgreSQL, S3 (with VPC endpoints), KMS
  |
  |-- Internet Gateway
  |-- FinCEN External API
```

1. **Route 53** and **CloudFront** handle DNS and content distribution.  
2. **S3** stores static front-end assets.  
3. **VPC** has multiple subnets (public, private) with strict security group rules:
   - Public subnets for Load Balancers, NAT, Bastion.  
   - Private subnets for microservices and database.  
4. **KMS** manages encryption keys for all sensitive data.  
5. **Internet Gateway** provides controlled outbound access.

---

## 5. Cloud Tech Stack Recommendations

1. **Microservices**  
   - **AWS Lambda**: Best for short-lived, event-driven tasks (e.g., Authentication Microservice, Document ingestion).  
   - **AWS Fargate**: Best for longer-running workloads or tasks with complex resource needs (e.g., Reporting Company, Beneficial Owner, FinCEN Integration).

2. **Database Choice**  
   - **Primary**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for ACID transactions, relational queries, and strong compliance controls.  
   - **Secondary**: DynamoDB for sessions, rate-limiting, or high-throughput logs if required.

3. **Supporting Services**  
   - **Amazon Cognito**: End-user authentication and authorization.  
   - **AWS KMS**: Centralized encryption key management.  
   - **S3**: Document storage with SSE-KMS encryption.  
   - **API Gateway**: Unified interface for all microservices.  
   - **Elastic Load Balancing** (ALB) for container-based services on private subnets if needed.

4. **CI/CD & IAC**  
   - **CodePipeline & CodeBuild**: Automated build, test, and deploy.  
   - **CloudFormation / Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for consistent, repeatable environment provisioning.

---

## 6. Security Deep Dive

### 6.1 IAM Policies & Least Privilege

- **Principles**: Enforce least privilege, role-based access, and separation of duties.  
- **Service Roles**:  
  - Lambda Execution Role (access to relevant resources only)  
  - Fargate Task Role (pull images, read secrets)  
  - FinCEN Integration Role (restricted to SQS, KMS decrypt for credentials)  
- **User Roles & Access**:  
  - Administrator Role (MFA, minimal membership)  
  - Developer Role (limited environment management)  
  - Security/Compliance Role (read-only on production for audits)  
- **Resource-Level Permissions**:  
  - Fine-grained S3 bucket policies, restricted RDS access via Secrets Manager, and tight KMS key policies.

### 6.2 Audit & Compliance

- **AWS CloudTrail**:  
  - Multi-region trails, log file validation, dedicated SSE-KMS–encrypted S3 bucket.  
- **AWS Config**:  
  - Track resource changes, enforce encryption, detect open security groups.  
  - Config rules (managed + custom) for compliance checks (e.g., “no open S3 buckets," “encryption required”).  
- **Logging & Monitoring**:  
  - Centralize all logs in CloudWatch.  
  - Set alerts for error rates, unusual usage patterns (KMS usage, suspicious IPs).

### 6.3 KMS Key Management

- **Multiple CMKs**: Separate keys for application data, documents, logging.  
- **Automatic Rotation**: Yearly rotation by AWS (or more frequent if compliance dictates).  
- **Permissions**: Restrict key admin privileges to a small set of security admins; usage privileges to specific microservices.  
- **Auditing**: All Encrypt/Decrypt operations logged in CloudTrail.

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability Planning

1. **Load Testing**  
   - Use tools like JMeter, Locust, or AWS-native solutions to simulate user spikes.  
   - Validate autoscaling triggers for Lambda concurrency and Fargate’s CPU/memory thresholds.

2. **Caching Strategy**  
   - **ElastiCache** (Redis or Memcached) to handle frequent lookups or repeated queries.  
   - **CloudFront** for global edge caching of static assets.

3. **Autoscaling**  
   - **Lambda** automatically scales with request volume.  
   - **Fargate** scaling policies tied to CPU/memory usage or queue length.  
   - Regularly test failover and bursting scenarios to ensure minimal latency under peak load.

4. **Global Distribution**  
   - Use **CloudFront** to reduce latency for worldwide users.  
   - Route 53 DNS for geo-routing if user base is highly regional.

---

## 8. Consolidated Key Points

1. **Architecture**: Microservices-based, multi-layered system on AWS with event-driven and containerized workloads.  
2. **Data Management**: Encrypted RDS PostgreSQL for relational data (companies, beneficial owners), optional DynamoDB for high-throughput use cases.  
3. **Security**: Comprehensive IAM strategy, multi-region CloudTrail, AWS Config rules, TLS encryption, KMS key management.  
4. **FinCEN Integration**: Dedicated microservice with retry logic for external BOI filings.  
5. **Scalability**: Combines AWS Lambda (short, event-driven tasks) with AWS Fargate (predictable or longer workloads).  
6. **Multi-Channel Support**: Web (React/Angular) + Mobile (React Native) over secure API Gateway endpoints.  
7. **Compliance & Auditing**: Logging, encryption, and validations at every layer (CloudTrail, KMS, SSE, IAM least-privilege).  
8. **Performance**: Load testing, caching layers (ElastiCache, CloudFront), autoscaling, global distribution for consistent user experience.

</overall solution design>

<UI specific design choices>
1. **Client Layer**  
   - **Web Application**: React or Angular front-end hosted on Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront for static asset distribution.  
   - **Mobile Application**: Cross-platform (e.g., React Native) to speed up development while retaining near-native performance. Both web and mobile clients communicate via secure APIs over HTTPS.

2. **Mobile Approach**  
   - **Cross-Platform**: React Native shortens time-to-market and simplifies updates by using a single shared codebase. Native device features (camera for document uploads, push notifications, etc.) can still be used for a smooth user experience.

- Use icons or labels on content (documents, forms) indicating the required privilege (e.g., “Admin Only”).

**4.3 Audit Log Presentation**  
- Dedicated “Audit Log” page with filters for date range, user, action type (VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, SUBMIT).  
- Each log entry includes a timestamp, user, action, and relevant resource.  
- Highlight critical actions (e.g., data modifications, file deletions) in bold or with a warning color.

**4.4 Data Sensitivity Indicators**  
- For fields that store sensitive PII (SSN, birthdate, addresses), display a subtle icon or a lock symbol to remind users of protection obligations.  
- Possibly show “encrypted” badges or disclaimers about data usage and access restrictions.

---

**5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS**  
**5.1 Recommended Frameworks & Libraries**  
- **Front-End (Web)**:  
  - React + MUI (Material-UI) or Angular + Angular Material.  
- **Cross-Platform Mobile**:  
  - React Native for synergy with web React code components.  

**5.2 State Management Approach**  
- **Redux or Redux Toolkit** (for React/React Native) or **NgRx** (for Angular) to manage global state consistently, especially for user authentication state, filing data, and offline caching.  
- For React Native, incorporate libraries like **react-query** or **redux-persist** to handle offline data more gracefully.

**5.3 Performance Optimization Strategies**  
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**: Load heavy components (e.g., advanced forms, chart libraries) on demand.  
- **Memoization**: Cache calculations and avoid re-rendering in React or Angular unless data changes.  
- **Network Optimizations**: Use GraphQL or well-structured REST endpoints to reduce over-fetching.  
- **Image Handling**: Compress large images (especially from camera uploads) before upload.

**5.4 Shared Code Opportunities Between Web & Mobile**  
- **Business Logic** & Validation: House common logic in a separate library or service that both apps can import.  
- **UI Components**: Some common styling or design tokens can be shared via style guides (e.g., using a token-based design system with consistent colors, spacing, typography).

### Responsive Design Considerations
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: 0-599px
  - Tablet: 600-959px
  - Desktop: 960px+

- **Layout Adaptations**:
  - Collapsible sidebar on smaller screens (hamburger menu)
  - Single column layout on mobile, multi-column on larger screens
  - Stacked cards on mobile, grid layout on desktop
  - Responsive tables that collapse into cards on mobile
  - Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44x44px)

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Lazy loading of components not visible in viewport
  - Code splitting by route for faster initial load
  - Optimized images with responsive sizing
  - Reduced animation on mobile to preserve battery

### User Flows for Critical Processes

#### New BOI Filing Process
1. User navigates to Dashboard
2. Clicks "New Filing" button
3. Step 1: Select entity from dropdown or create new
4. Step 2: Add/select beneficial owners
5. Step 3: Upload supporting documentation
6. Step 4: Review all information
7. Step 5: Submit to FinCEN or save as draft
8. Confirmation screen with filing reference number
9. Option to download PDF receipt

#### Document Upload and Verification
1. User navigates to Document Management
2. Clicks "Upload Document" button
3. Selects document type from dropdown
4. Chooses file or uses drag-and-drop
5. System performs initial validation (file type, size)
6. User adds metadata (description, associated entity/owner)
7. System performs OCR and data extraction if applicable
8. Preview screen shows extracted information
9. User confirms or edits extracted data
10. Document saved and associated with relevant entities/owners

## 3. MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGN

### Mobile-Specific UI Adaptations
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar for primary navigation instead of sidebar
- **Content Density**: Reduced information density with more white space
- **Typography**: Slightly larger font sizes (minimum 16px for body text)
- **Touch Targets**: Larger buttons and interactive elements (minimum 44x44px)
- **Forms**: Single column layout with full-width inputs
- **Tables**: Converted to card-based lists for better mobile viewing
- **Gestures**: Swipe actions for common tasks (archive, mark as complete)

### Native Feature Integration
- **Camera**: 
  - Document scanning and capture for ID verification
  - OCR capabilities to extract text from documents
  - QR code scanning for quick entity lookup
  
- **Biometric Authentication**:
  - Face ID/Touch ID for secure login
  - Step-up authentication for sensitive operations
  
- **Notifications**:
  - Push notifications for filing deadlines
  - Approval requests
  - Status changes on submissions
  - Compliance alerts
  
- **Offline Mode**:
  - Cached data for viewing when offline
  - Offline form completion with sync when online
  - Background synchronization when connection restored
  
- **Device Storage**:
  - Secure document caching with encryption
  - Automatic cleanup of sensitive data

### Navigation Pattern
- **Primary Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with 5 main sections
  - Home/Dashboard
  - Entities & Owners
  - Filings
  - Documents
  - Profile/Settings

- **Secondary Navigation**:
  - Hierarchical navigation with back button
  - "More" menu for less frequently used features
  - Pull-to-refresh for content updates

### Offline Capabilities and Synchronization Approach

#### Offline Data Strategy
- **Cached Data**:
  - Essential reference data cached locally (entity lists, owner information)
  - Recent filing drafts and documents stored in encrypted local storage
  - User preferences and settings maintained offline

- **Data Prioritization**:
  - Critical data synced first when connection restored (filing deadlines, urgent notifications)
  - Background sync for larger documents when on Wi-Fi
  - Configurable sync preferences (cellular data limits)

#### Synchronization Mechanism
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Timestamp-based versioning for detecting conflicts
  - User notification for manual resolution of conflicting changes
  - Server-side validation to ensure data integrity

- **Queue Management**:
  - Persistent queue for pending operations (create, update, delete)
  - Background sync service that processes queue when online
  - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed operations

- **Sync Status Indicators**:
  - Visual indicators showing sync status (pending, in progress, complete)
  - Detailed sync history accessible from settings
  - Notification when critical operations complete

### Responsive Design Considerations
- Fluid layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px+
- Collapsible sidebar for tablet and mobile views
- Stacked card layout for dashboards in mobile view
- Simplified tables with horizontal scrolling for mobile
- Touch-friendly UI elements (minimum 44px × 44px touch targets)
- Form layouts that adapt from multi-column (desktop) to single column (mobile)
- Optimized data loading for limited bandwidth scenarios

### User Flows for Critical Processes

#### BOI Filing Submission Flow
1. User navigates to BOI Filings section
2. Selects "Create New Filing"
3. Enters Reporting Company Information
   - Validation occurs on completion
   - Sensitive fields marked with appropriate indicators
4. Proceeds to Beneficial Owners section
   - Can add multiple owners
   - Document upload for ID verification
   - Ownership details specification
5. Reviews all information
6. Submits filing or saves as draft
7. Receives confirmation with filing ID
8. Can track status on dashboard

#### Document Upload and Management Flow
1. User navigates to Document Management
2. Selects "Upload New Document"
3. Chooses document type from dropdown
4. Selects entity/owner associated with document
5. Sets document sensitivity level
6. Uploads file (drag-and-drop or file browser)
7. Preview displayed with option to rotate/crop
8. Adds metadata (expiration date, description)
9. Submits and receives encryption confirmation
10. Document appears in relevant sections with appropriate access controls

## 3. MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGN

### Mobile-Specific UI Adaptations
- Single column layout optimized for vertical scrolling
- Bottom navigation bar for primary actions (replaces sidebar)
- Floating action button (FAB) for primary create actions
- Simplified header with dropdown menu
- Swipe gestures for common actions (archive, mark complete)
- Collapsible sections to manage information density
- Mobile-optimized forms with larger input fields
- Sticky call-to-action buttons always visible at bottom of screen

### Native Feature Integration
- **Camera Access**: 
  - Document scanning with automatic edge detection
  - OCR for extracting data from ID documents
  - ID verification using device camera
- **Biometric Authentication**:
  - Fingerprint/Face ID login option
  - Secondary biometric verification for sensitive actions
- **Push Notifications**:
  - Filing status updates
  - Compliance deadline reminders
  - Document approval requests
  - Security alerts
- **Offline Mode**:
  - Form data cached for completion without connectivity
  - Document queue for uploads when connection is restored
- **Calendar Integration**:
  - Add compliance deadlines to device calendar
  - Set reminders for upcoming filings

### Navigation Pattern
- **Primary**: Tab-based bottom navigation with 5 key sections:
  - Dashboard
  - Filings
  - Documents
  - Entities
  - Profile
- **Secondary**: Drawer menu accessed via hamburger icon for less frequent actions:
  - Settings
  - Help & Support
  - About
  - Terms & Policies
  - Logout
- **Tertiary**: In-page navigation via:
  - Breadcrumbs for deep navigation paths
  - Back button in header
  - Swipe gestures between related screens

### State Management Approach

#### Layered State Architecture
```
Global Application State (Redux/Zustand/NgRx)
├── Authentication State
│   ├── User profile
│   ├── Permissions
│   └── Session information
├── UI State
│   ├── Theme preferences
│   ├── Layout settings
│   └── Notification state
├── Entity Data State
│   ├── Companies
│   ├── Beneficial owners
│   └── Documents metadata
└── Form State (Local)
    ├── Current form values
    ├── Validation state
    └── Submission state
```

#### State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: Use React Query/SWR (React) or RxJS (Angular) for:
  - Data fetching with caching
  - Automatic refetching
  - Pagination handling
  - Optimistic updates
- **Client State**: Use Redux/Zustand/NgRx for:
  - Authentication state
  - Global UI state
  - Cross-component shared state
- **Local State**: Use component state/hooks for:
  - UI interactions
  - Form state during editing
  - Component-specific toggling

### Performance Optimization Strategies

- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- Efficient bundling with Webpack/Rollup
- Asset optimization (images, fonts)
- Prefetching critical resources

#### Runtime Performance
- Memoization of expensive calculations (useMemo, useCallback)
- Virtualized lists for long scrollable content
- Debouncing/throttling for frequent events
- Strategic re-rendering prevention
- Web workers for heavy calculations
- Skeleton screens during data loading

#### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Hermes JavaScript engine for React Native
- Image resizing before upload
- Progressive loading of high-resolution assets
- Minimize bridge crossing in React Native
- Native modules for performance-critical features

### Shared Code Opportunities Between Web and Mobile

#### Architecture for Code Sharing
```
/src
├── /core               # Shared business logic
│   ├── /api            # API interfaces
│   ├── /models         # Data models
│   ├── /utils          # Shared utilities
│   └── /validation     # Validation rules
├── /ui-components      # Shared component patterns
│   ├── /web            # Web implementations
│   └── /mobile         # Mobile implementations
├── /features           # Feature modules
│   ├── /auth           # Authentication logic
│   ├── /filing         # Filing business logic
│   └── /documents      # Document handling
├── /web                # Web-specific code
└── /mobile             # Mobile-specific code
```

#### Specific Sharing Strategies
- **Business Logic**: 
  - Use TypeScript for shared models and interfaces
  - Create platform-agnostic services for core functionality
  - Share validation rules and form schemas

- **UI Component Patterns**:
  - Define common component interfaces
  - Implement platform-specific versions with same API
  - Share styling constants and theming

- **State Management**:
  - Share Redux/Zustand stores and reducers
  - Use adapters for platform-specific persistence

- **API Communication**:
  - Share API client configuration
  - Use same data transformation and normalization

- **Testing**:
  - Share test fixtures and mock data
  - Unified testing strategy across platforms

This comprehensive front-end design provides a solid foundation for building a secure, accessible, and user-friendly BOI Compliance Management Platform across both web and mobile devices, with careful attention to security, compliance, and user experience.
