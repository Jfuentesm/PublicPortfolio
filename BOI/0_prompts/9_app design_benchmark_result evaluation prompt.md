## 4. Detailed Technical Component Diagrams (Text Summaries)

### 4.1 Data Flow Diagram

```
[Clients: Web & Mobile] -- (HTTPS/TLS) --> [API Gateway] --> [Microservices]
   - Authentication Service (Lambda)
   - Reporting Company (Fargate)
   - Beneficial Owner (Fargate)
   - Document Management (Lambda)
   - FinCEN Integration (Fargate)
             |
             v
          [Data Layer: RDS PostgreSQL, S3]
             |
             v
       [FinCEN External API]
```

1. **Clients** (Web & Mobile) communicate over secure HTTPS.  
2. **API Gateway** routes requests to different microservices.  
3. **Microservices** handle authentication, company info management, beneficial owner details, document processing, and external FinCEN filing.  
4. **Data Storage** uses encrypted RDS for relational data and S3 for document storage.  
5. **FinCEN API** is an external endpoint that receives sensitive BOI data submissions.

### 4.2 Deployment Diagram

```
[AWS Region]
  |
  |-- Route 53 (DNS)
  |-- CloudFront (CDN)
  |-- S3 (Static web assets)
  |
  |-- VPC
       |-- Public Subnets: Load Balancer, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host
       |-- Private App Subnets: API Gateway (private), Lambda, ECS/Fargate
       |-- Private Data Subnets: RDS PostgreSQL, S3 (with VPC endpoints), KMS
  |
  |-- Internet Gateway
  |-- FinCEN External API
```

1. **Route 53** and **CloudFront** handle DNS and content distribution.  
2. **S3** stores static front-end assets.  
3. **VPC** has multiple subnets (public, private) with strict security group rules:
   - Public subnets for Load Balancers, NAT, Bastion.  
   - Private subnets for microservices and database.  
4. **KMS** manages encryption keys for all sensitive data.  
5. **Internet Gateway** provides controlled outbound access.

---

## 5. Cloud Tech Stack Recommendations

1. **Microservices**  
   - **AWS Lambda**: Best for short-lived, event-driven tasks (e.g., Authentication Microservice, Document ingestion).  
   - **AWS Fargate**: Best for longer-running workloads or tasks with complex resource needs (e.g., Reporting Company, Beneficial Owner, FinCEN Integration).

2. **Database Choice**  
   - **Primary**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for ACID transactions, relational queries, and strong compliance controls.  
   - **Secondary**: DynamoDB for sessions, rate-limiting, or high-throughput logs if required.

3. **Supporting Services**  
   - **Amazon Cognito**: End-user authentication and authorization.  
   - **AWS KMS**: Centralized encryption key management.  
   - **S3**: Document storage with SSE-KMS encryption.  
   - **API Gateway**: Unified interface for all microservices.  
   - **Elastic Load Balancing** (ALB) for container-based services on private subnets if needed.

4. **CI/CD & IAC**  
   - **CodePipeline & CodeBuild**: Automated build, test, and deploy.  
   - **CloudFormation / Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for consistent, repeatable environment provisioning.

---

## 6. Security Deep Dive

### 6.1 IAM Policies & Least Privilege

- **Principles**: Enforce least privilege, role-based access, and separation of duties.  
- **Service Roles**:  
  - Lambda Execution Role (access to relevant resources only)  
  - Fargate Task Role (pull images, read secrets)  
  - FinCEN Integration Role (restricted to SQS, KMS decrypt for credentials)  
- **User Roles & Access**:  
  - Administrator Role (MFA, minimal membership)  
  - Developer Role (limited environment management)  
  - Security/Compliance Role (read-only on production for audits)  
- **Resource-Level Permissions**:  
  - Fine-grained S3 bucket policies, restricted RDS access via Secrets Manager, and tight KMS key policies.

### 6.2 Audit & Compliance

- **AWS CloudTrail**:  
  - Multi-region trails, log file validation, dedicated SSE-KMS–encrypted S3 bucket.  
- **AWS Config**:  
  - Track resource changes, enforce encryption, detect open security groups.  
  - Config rules (managed + custom) for compliance checks (e.g., “no open S3 buckets," “encryption required”).  
- **Logging & Monitoring**:  
  - Centralize all logs in CloudWatch.  
  - Set alerts for error rates, unusual usage patterns (KMS usage, suspicious IPs).

### 6.3 KMS Key Management

- **Multiple CMKs**: Separate keys for application data, documents, logging.  
- **Automatic Rotation**: Yearly rotation by AWS (or more frequent if compliance dictates).  
- **Permissions**: Restrict key admin privileges to a small set of security admins; usage privileges to specific microservices.  
- **Auditing**: All Encrypt/Decrypt operations logged in CloudTrail.

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability Planning

1. **Load Testing**  
   - Use tools like JMeter, Locust, or AWS-native solutions to simulate user spikes.  
   - Validate autoscaling triggers for Lambda concurrency and Fargate’s CPU/memory thresholds.

2. **Caching Strategy**  
   - **ElastiCache** (Redis or Memcached) to handle frequent lookups or repeated queries.  
   - **CloudFront** for global edge caching of static assets.

3. **Autoscaling**  
   - **Lambda** automatically scales with request volume.  
   - **Fargate** scaling policies tied to CPU/memory usage or queue length.  
   - Regularly test failover and bursting scenarios to ensure minimal latency under peak load.

4. **Global Distribution**  
   - Use **CloudFront** to reduce latency for worldwide users.  
   - Route 53 DNS for geo-routing if user base is highly regional.

---

## 8. Consolidated Key Points

1. **Architecture**: Microservices-based, multi-layered system on AWS with event-driven and containerized workloads.  
2. **Data Management**: Encrypted RDS PostgreSQL for relational data (companies, beneficial owners), optional DynamoDB for high-throughput use cases.  
3. **Security**: Comprehensive IAM strategy, multi-region CloudTrail, AWS Config rules, TLS encryption, KMS key management.  
4. **FinCEN Integration**: Dedicated microservice with retry logic for external BOI filings.  
5. **Scalability**: Combines AWS Lambda (short, event-driven tasks) with AWS Fargate (predictable or longer workloads).  
6. **Multi-Channel Support**: Web (React/Angular) + Mobile (React Native) over secure API Gateway endpoints.  
7. **Compliance & Auditing**: Logging, encryption, and validations at every layer (CloudTrail, KMS, SSE, IAM least-privilege).  
8. **Performance**: Load testing, caching layers (ElastiCache, CloudFront), autoscaling, global distribution for consistent user experience.

</overall solution design>

<UI specific design choices>
1. **Client Layer**  
   - **Web Application**: React or Angular front-end hosted on Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront for static asset distribution.  
   - **Mobile Application**: Cross-platform (e.g., React Native) to speed up development while retaining near-native performance. Both web and mobile clients communicate via secure APIs over HTTPS.

2. **Mobile Approach**  
   - **Cross-Platform**: React Native shortens time-to-market and simplifies updates by using a single shared codebase. Native device features (camera for document uploads, push notifications, etc.) can still be used for a smooth user experience.

**4.3 Audit Log Presentation**  
- Dedicated “Audit Log” page with filters for date range, user, action type (VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, SUBMIT).  
- Each log entry includes a timestamp, user, action, and relevant resource.  
- Highlight critical actions (e.g., data modifications, file deletions) in bold or with a warning color.

**4.4 Data Sensitivity Indicators**  
- For fields that store sensitive PII (SSN, birthdate, addresses), display a subtle icon or a lock symbol to remind users of protection obligations.  
- Possibly show “encrypted” badges or disclaimers about data usage and access restrictions.

---

**5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS**  
**5.1 Recommended Frameworks & Libraries**  
- **Front-End (Web)**:  
  - React + MUI (Material-UI) or Angular + Angular Material.  
- **Cross-Platform Mobile**:  
  - React Native for synergy with web React code components.  

**5.2 State Management Approach**  
- **Redux or Redux Toolkit** (for React/React Native) or **NgRx** (for Angular) to manage global state consistently, especially for user authentication state, filing data, and offline caching.  
- For React Native, incorporate libraries like **react-query** or **redux-persist** to handle offline data more gracefully.

**5.3 Performance Optimization Strategies**  
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**: Load heavy components (e.g., advanced forms, chart libraries) on demand.  
- **Memoization**: Cache calculations and avoid re-rendering in React or Angular unless data changes.  
- **Network Optimizations**: Use GraphQL or well-structured REST endpoints to reduce over-fetching.  
- **Image Handling**: Compress large images (especially from camera uploads) before upload.

**5.4 Shared Code Opportunities Between Web & Mobile**  
- **Business Logic** & Validation: House common logic in a separate library or service that both apps can import.  
- **UI Components**: Some common styling or design tokens can be shared via style guides (e.g., using a token-based design system with consistent colors, spacing, typography).

### Responsive Design Considerations
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: 0-599px
  - Tablet: 600-959px
  - Desktop: 960px+

- **Layout Adaptations**:
  - Collapsible sidebar on smaller screens (hamburger menu)
  - Single column layout on mobile, multi-column on larger screens
  - Stacked cards on mobile, grid layout on desktop
  - Responsive tables that collapse into cards on mobile
  - Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44x44px)

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Lazy loading of components not visible in viewport
  - Code splitting by route for faster initial load
  - Optimized images with responsive sizing
  - Reduced animation on mobile to preserve battery

### User Flows for Critical Processes

#### New BOI Filing Process
1. User navigates to Dashboard
2. Clicks "New Filing" button
3. Step 1: Select entity from dropdown or create new
4. Step 2: Add/select beneficial owners
5. Step 3: Upload supporting documentation
6. Step 4: Review all information
7. Step 5: Submit to FinCEN or save as draft
8. Confirmation screen with filing reference number
9. Option to download PDF receipt

#### Document Upload and Verification
1. User navigates to Document Management
2. Clicks "Upload Document" button
3. Selects document type from dropdown
4. Chooses file or uses drag-and-drop
5. System performs initial validation (file type, size)
6. User adds metadata (description, associated entity/owner)
7. System performs OCR and data extraction if applicable
8. Preview screen shows extracted information
9. User confirms or edits extracted data
10. Document saved and associated with relevant entities/owners

## 3. MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGN

### Mobile-Specific UI Adaptations
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar for primary navigation instead of sidebar
- **Content Density**: Reduced information density with more white space
- **Typography**: Slightly larger font sizes (minimum 16px for body text)
- **Touch Targets**: Larger buttons and interactive elements (minimum 44x44px)
- **Forms**: Single column layout with full-width inputs
- **Tables**: Converted to card-based lists for better mobile viewing
- **Gestures**: Swipe actions for common tasks (archive, mark as complete)

### Native Feature Integration
- **Camera**: 
  - Document scanning and capture for ID verification
  - OCR capabilities to extract text from documents
  - QR code scanning for quick entity lookup
  
- **Biometric Authentication**:
  - Face ID/Touch ID for secure login
  - Step-up authentication for sensitive operations
  
- **Notifications**:
  - Push notifications for filing deadlines
  - Approval requests
  - Status changes on submissions
  - Compliance alerts
  
- **Offline Mode**:
  - Cached data for viewing when offline
  - Offline form completion with sync when online
  - Background synchronization when connection restored
  
- **Device Storage**:
  - Secure document caching with encryption
  - Automatic cleanup of sensitive data

### Navigation Pattern
- **Primary Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with 5 main sections
  - Home/Dashboard
  - Entities & Owners
  - Filings
  - Documents
  - Profile/Settings

- **Secondary Navigation**:
  - Hierarchical navigation with back button
  - "More" menu for less frequently used features
  - Pull-to-refresh for content updates

### Offline Capabilities and Synchronization Approach

#### Offline Data Strategy
- **Cached Data**:
  - Essential reference data cached locally (entity lists, owner information)
  - Recent filing drafts and documents stored in encrypted local storage
  - User preferences and settings maintained offline

- **Data Prioritization**:
  - Critical data synced first when connection restored (filing deadlines, urgent notifications)
  - Background sync for larger documents when on Wi-Fi
  - Configurable sync preferences (cellular data limits)

#### Synchronization Mechanism
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Timestamp-based versioning for detecting conflicts
  - User notification for manual resolution of conflicting changes
  - Server-side validation to ensure data integrity

- **Queue Management**:
  - Persistent queue for pending operations (create, update, delete)
  - Background sync service that processes queue when online
  - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed operations

- **Sync Status Indicators**:
  - Visual indicators showing sync status (pending, in progress, complete)
  - Detailed sync history accessible from settings
  - Notification when critical operations complete

### Responsive Design Considerations
- Fluid layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px+
- Collapsible sidebar for tablet and mobile views
- Stacked card layout for dashboards in mobile view
- Simplified tables with horizontal scrolling for mobile
- Touch-friendly UI elements (minimum 44px × 44px touch targets)
- Form layouts that adapt from multi-column (desktop) to single column (mobile)
- Optimized data loading for limited bandwidth scenarios

### User Flows for Critical Processes

#### BOI Filing Submission Flow
1. User navigates to BOI Filings section
2. Selects "Create New Filing"
3. Enters Reporting Company Information
   - Validation occurs on completion
   - Sensitive fields marked with appropriate indicators
4. Proceeds to Beneficial Owners section
   - Can add multiple owners
   - Document upload for ID verification
   - Ownership details specification
5. Reviews all information
6. Submits filing or saves as draft
7. Receives confirmation with filing ID
8. Can track status on dashboard

#### Document Upload and Management Flow
1. User navigates to Document Management
2. Selects "Upload New Document"
3. Chooses document type from dropdown
4. Selects entity/owner associated with document
5. Sets document sensitivity level
6. Uploads file (drag-and-drop or file browser)
7. Preview displayed with option to rotate/crop
8. Adds metadata (expiration date, description)
9. Submits and receives encryption confirmation
10. Document appears in relevant sections with appropriate access controls

## 3. MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGN

### Mobile-Specific UI Adaptations
- Single column layout optimized for vertical scrolling
- Bottom navigation bar for primary actions (replaces sidebar)
- Floating action button (FAB) for primary create actions
- Simplified header with dropdown menu
- Swipe gestures for common actions (archive, mark complete)
- Collapsible sections to manage information density
- Mobile-optimized forms with larger input fields
- Sticky call-to-action buttons always visible at bottom of screen

### Native Feature Integration
- **Camera Access**: 
  - Document scanning with automatic edge detection
  - OCR for extracting data from ID documents
  - ID verification using device camera
- **Biometric Authentication**:
  - Fingerprint/Face ID login option
  - Secondary biometric verification for sensitive actions
- **Push Notifications**:
  - Filing status updates
  - Compliance deadline reminders
  - Document approval requests
  - Security alerts
- **Offline Mode**:
  - Form data cached for completion without connectivity
  - Document queue for uploads when connection is restored
- **Calendar Integration**:
  - Add compliance deadlines to device calendar
  - Set reminders for upcoming filings

### Navigation Pattern
- **Primary**: Tab-based bottom navigation with 5 key sections:
  - Dashboard
  - Filings
  - Documents
  - Entities
  - Profile
- **Secondary**: Drawer menu accessed via hamburger icon for less frequent actions:
  - Settings
  - Help & Support
  - About
  - Terms & Policies
  - Logout
- **Tertiary**: In-page navigation via:
  - Breadcrumbs for deep navigation paths
  - Back button in header
  - Swipe gestures between related screens

### State Management Approach

#### Layered State Architecture
```
Global Application State (Redux/Zustand/NgRx)
├── Authentication State
│   ├── User profile
│   ├── Permissions
│   └── Session information
├── UI State
│   ├── Theme preferences
│   ├── Layout settings
│   └── Notification state
├── Entity Data State
│   ├── Companies
│   ├── Beneficial owners
│   └── Documents metadata
└── Form State (Local)
    ├── Current form values
    ├── Validation state
    └── Submission state
```

#### State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: Use React Query/SWR (React) or RxJS (Angular) for:
  - Data fetching with caching
  - Automatic refetching
  - Pagination handling
  - Optimistic updates
- **Client State**: Use Redux/Zustand/NgRx for:
  - Authentication state
  - Global UI state
  - Cross-component shared state
- **Local State**: Use component state/hooks for:
  - UI interactions
  - Form state during editing
  - Component-specific toggling

### Performance Optimization Strategies

#### Loading Performance

- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- Efficient bundling with Webpack/Rollup
- Asset optimization (images, fonts)
- Prefetching critical resources

#### Runtime Performance
- Memoization of expensive calculations (useMemo, useCallback)
- Virtualized lists for long scrollable content
- Debouncing/throttling for frequent events
- Strategic re-rendering prevention
- Web workers for heavy calculations
- Skeleton screens during data loading

#### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Hermes JavaScript engine for React Native
- Image resizing before upload
- Progressive loading of high-resolution assets
- Minimize bridge crossing in React Native
- Native modules for performance-critical features

### Shared Code Opportunities Between Web and Mobile

  - Define common component interfaces
  - Implement platform-specific versions with same API
  - Share styling constants and theming

- **State Management**:
  - Share Redux/Zustand stores and reducers
  - Use adapters for platform-specific persistence

- **API Communication**:
  - Share API client configuration
  - Use same data transformation and normalization

- **Testing**:
  - Share test fixtures and mock data
  - Unified testing strategy across platforms

3. MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGN
The mobile app, built with React Native, adapts the web experience for smaller screens and touch interactions, leveraging native features for convenience.
Mobile-Specific UI Adaptations
Navigation: Simplified to core actions (Dashboard, Filings, Documents).

Touch Targets: Buttons and links ≥ 48px for easy tapping.

Forms: Vertical scrolling with large, finger-friendly inputs.

Gestures: Swipe to delete documents, pull-to-refresh lists.

Native Feature Integration
Camera: Capture document photos directly in the app.

Notifications: Push alerts for deadlines and status updates.

Biometrics: Fingerprint/face login for quick, secure access.

Navigation Pattern
Bottom Tab Bar: Icons + labels for Dashboard, Filings, Documents, Settings.

Drawer: Hidden menu for Help & Support, accessed via hamburger icon.

Key Screen Mockups Optimized for Mobile
Dashboard:
Top: Greeting (e.g., "Hello, [User]").

Middle: Stacked cards (Compliance Status, Recent Filings).

Bottom: Floating "+" button for new filings.

Visual: Compact, vertical layout with teal tabs.

BOI Filing Form:
Layout: Single-column, scrollable with step indicators (e.g., "2/3").

Fields: Large inputs, camera button for uploads.

Buttons: Full-width "Next" and "Submit".

Visual: White background, blue progress dots.

Document Management:
List: Vertical stack with thumbnails, swipe-to-delete.

Upload: Camera or gallery picker via icon.

Visual: Minimalist with coral accents for actions.

Offline Capabilities and Synchronization Approach
Offline Mode: Save filing drafts locally using AsyncStorage.

Sync: Background upload when online, with progress indicator.

Conflict Resolution: Timestamp-based priority for data consistency.

4. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE UI ELEMENTS
Security and compliance are visually reinforced to protect sensitive PII and meet FinCEN requirements.
Authentication Screens and Flows
Login Screen: Email/password fields, biometric toggle (mobile), "Forgot Password?" link.

MFA Prompt: Code input field post-login, sent via email/SMS.

Password Reset: Email verification → New password form.

Permission Visualization
Indicators: Lock icons on restricted areas (e.g., User Management for non-admins).

Tooltips: Explain restrictions (e.g., "Admin Only").

Roles: Displayed in user profile (e.g., "Admin", "Editor").

Audit Log Presentation (Admin Only)
Table: Columns (Date, User, Action, Details).

Features: Filter by date/user, export as CSV.

Visual: Gray table with blue export button.

Data Sensitivity Indicators
Badges: Red "Sensitive" tags on fields like SSN.

Masking: Default to "••••" with "Reveal" toggle (requires MFA re-auth).

5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
These recommendations align with the AWS-based architecture and React ecosystem.
Recommended Frameworks and Libraries
Web: React + TypeScript for scalability, hosted on S3/CloudFront.

Mobile: React Native for cross-platform efficiency.

UI Library: Material-UI for pre-styled, accessible components.

State Management Approach
Global: Redux for app-wide state (e.g., user data, filings).

Local: React hooks (useState, useContext) for transient UI state.

Performance Optimization Strategies
Lazy Loading: Split code by route (e.g., Dashboard vs. Filings).

Image Optimization: Use WebP format, responsive sizes.

Caching: Browser cache for static assets, API caching via CloudFront.

Shared Code Opportunities Between Web and Mobile
Logic: Share API calls and validation via React Native Web.

Components: Reuse buttons, forms with platform-specific styling.

This front-end design delivers a secure, user-friendly BOI Compliance Management Platform, seamlessly integrating with FinCEN and supporting both web and mobile users. It balances modern aesthetics with robust functionality, ensuring compliance and accessibility for all users.
