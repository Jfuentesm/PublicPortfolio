# BOI Compliance Management Platform Documentation

## 1. Purpose

This document consolidates the **entire project’s architecture, security measures, technology stack, and performance considerations** for a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) compliance management platform. The platform:

1. **Handles sensitive PII data** for business owners.  
2. **Integrates with FinCEN** for BOI filings.  
3. **Uses AWS cloud infrastructure** with a microservices architecture.  
4. **Adheres to high security and compliance standards**.  
5. **Supports both web and mobile clients**.

All information provided is structured to be parsed easily by an LLM agent that only accepts plain text.

## 2. System Context

1. **Sensitive PII Data**  
   - The platform manages confidential Beneficial Ownership Information, necessitating strict data protection and regulatory monitoring.

2. **FinCEN Integration**  
   - Securely interacts with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s API to submit and manage BOI filings.

3. **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**  
   - Leverages AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, RDS, S3, KMS, etc.) with a well-architected security approach.

4. **High Security and Compliance**  
   - Meets stringent observational, regulatory, and financial compliance standards, ensuring data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

5. **Multi-Channel Access**  
   - Enables access via web (React/Angular) and mobile (React Native) applications, connected through secure APIs (AWS API Gateway).

## 3. High-Level Solution Design

### 3.1 Architectural Overview (Text Summary)

- **Client Layer**  
  - **Web Application**: Hosted on S3 + CloudFront (React or Angular).  
  - **Mobile Application**: React Native with cross-platform builds, securely connecting over HTTPS.

- **API & Logic Layer**  
  - **Amazon API Gateway**: Single entry point for REST or GraphQL endpoints.  
  - **Microservices**: Implemented on AWS Lambda (serverless) or AWS Fargate (containerized) depending on workload.  
    - **Authentication Service** (Cognito + Lambda)  
    - **Reporting Company Service** (Fargate)  
    - **Beneficial Owner Service** (Fargate)  
    - **Document Management Service** (Lambda or hybrid)  
    - **FinCEN Integration Service** (Fargate)  
  - **Integration**: Orchestrates data exchange with FinCEN’s APIs, includes robust retry mechanisms.

- **Data & Storage Layer**  
  - **Primary Data Store**: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ).  
  - **Secondary (Optional)**: DynamoDB for high-throughput logs or session management.  
  - **Encryption**: AES-256 with AWS KMS keys for data at rest; TLS/SSL for data in transit.

- **Security & Compliance**  
  - **Authentication & Authorization**: Amazon Cognito, supplemented by fine-grained IAM roles.  
  - **Audit & Monitoring**: AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, CloudWatch.  
  - **Encryption**: KMS-managed keys, TLS/SSL throughout.  
  - **Least Privilege**: Strict IAM policies, separate roles, restricted subnets.

- **FinCEN Integration**  
  - A dedicated microservice handles all communication with FinCEN, leveraging queued jobs (SQS/Step Functions) to retriable calls in case of network issues or system errors.

- **Deployment & Scalability**  
  - **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for repeatable deployments.  
  - **Autoscaling**: Lambda concurrency or Fargate scaling policies.  
  - **CI/CD**: AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild for builds, tests, and rollouts.

- **Mobile Approach**  
  - **React Native**: Facilitates near-native performance with a single codebase.  
  - **Native Features**: Access mobile camera for document scanning, push notifications, etc.

## 4. Detailed Technical Component Diagrams (Text Summaries)

### 4.1 Data Flow Diagram

```
[Clients: Web & Mobile] -- (HTTPS/TLS) --> [API Gateway] --> [Microservices]
   - Authentication Service (Lambda)
   - Reporting Company (Fargate)
   - Beneficial Owner (Fargate)
   - Document Management (Lambda)
   - FinCEN Integration (Fargate)
             |
             v
          [Data Layer: RDS PostgreSQL, S3]
             |
             v
       [FinCEN External API]
```

1. **Clients** (Web & Mobile) communicate over secure HTTPS.  
2. **API Gateway** routes requests to different microservices.  
3. **Microservices** handle authentication, company info management, beneficial owner details, document processing, and external FinCEN filing.  
4. **Data Storage** uses encrypted RDS for relational data and S3 for document storage.  
5. **FinCEN API** is an external endpoint that receives sensitive BOI data submissions.

### 4.2 Deployment Diagram

```
[AWS Region]
  |
  |-- Route 53 (DNS)
  |-- CloudFront (CDN)
  |-- S3 (Static web assets)
  |
  |-- VPC
       |-- Public Subnets: Load Balancer, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host
       |-- Private App Subnets: API Gateway (private), Lambda, ECS/Fargate
       |-- Private Data Subnets: RDS PostgreSQL, S3 (with VPC endpoints), KMS
  |
  |-- Internet Gateway
  |-- FinCEN External API
```

1. **Route 53** and **CloudFront** handle DNS and content distribution.  
2. **S3** stores static front-end assets.  
3. **VPC** has multiple subnets (public, private) with strict security group rules:
   - Public subnets for Load Balancers, NAT, Bastion.  
   - Private subnets for microservices and database.  
4. **KMS** manages encryption keys for all sensitive data.  
5. **Internet Gateway** provides controlled outbound access.

## 5. Cloud Tech Stack Recommendations

1. **Microservices**  
   - **AWS Lambda**: Best for short-lived, event-driven tasks (e.g., Authentication Microservice, Document ingestion).  
   - **AWS Fargate**: Best for longer-running workloads or tasks with complex resource needs (e.g., Reporting Company, Beneficial Owner, FinCEN Integration).

2. **Database Choice**  
   - **Primary**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for ACID transactions, relational queries, and strong compliance controls.  
   - **Secondary**: DynamoDB for sessions, rate-limiting, or high-throughput logs if required.

3. **Supporting Services**  
   - **Amazon Cognito**: End-user authentication and authorization.  
   - **AWS KMS**: Centralized encryption key management.  
   - **S3**: Document storage with SSE-KMS encryption.  
   - **API Gateway**: Unified interface for all microservices.  
   - **Elastic Load Balancing** (ALB) for container-based services on private subnets if needed.

4. **CI/CD & IAC**  
   - **CodePipeline & CodeBuild**: Automated build, test, and deploy.  
   - **CloudFormation / Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for consistent, repeatable environment provisioning.

## 6. Security Deep Dive

### 6.1 IAM Policies & Least Privilege

- **Principles**: Enforce least privilege, role-based access, and separation of duties.  
- **Service Roles**:  
  - Lambda Execution Role (access to relevant resources only)  
  - Fargate Task Role (pull images, read secrets)  
  - FinCEN Integration Role (restricted to SQS, KMS decrypt for credentials)  
- **User Roles & Access**:  
  - Administrator Role (MFA, minimal membership)  
  - Developer Role (limited environment management)  
  - Security/Compliance Role (read-only on production for audits)  
- **Resource-Level Permissions**:  
  - Fine-grained S3 bucket policies, restricted RDS access via Secrets Manager, and tight KMS key policies.

### 6.2 Audit & Compliance

- **AWS CloudTrail**:  
  - Multi-region trails, log file validation, dedicated SSE-KMS–encrypted S3 bucket.  
- **AWS Config**:  
  - Track resource changes, enforce encryption, detect open security groups.  
  - Config rules (managed + custom) for compliance checks (e.g., “no open S3 buckets," “encryption required”).  
- **Logging & Monitoring**:  
  - Centralize all logs in CloudWatch.  
  - Set alerts for error rates, unusual usage patterns (KMS usage, suspicious IPs).

### 6.3 KMS Key Management

- **Multiple CMKs**: Separate keys for application data, documents, logging.  
- **Automatic Rotation**: Yearly rotation by AWS (or more frequent if compliance dictates).  
- **Permissions**: Restrict key admin privileges to a small set of security admins; usage privileges to specific microservices.  
- **Auditing**: All Encrypt/Decrypt operations logged in CloudTrail.

## 7. Performance & Scalability Planning

1. **Load Testing**  
   - Use tools like JMeter, Locust, or AWS-native solutions to simulate user spikes.  
   - Validate autoscaling triggers for Lambda concurrency and Fargate’s CPU/memory thresholds.

2. **Caching Strategy**  
   - **ElastiCache** (Redis or Memcached) to handle frequent lookups or repeated queries.  
   - **CloudFront** for global edge caching of static assets.

3. **Autoscaling**  
   - **Lambda** automatically scales with request volume.  
   - **Fargate** scaling policies tied to CPU/memory usage or queue length.  
   - Regularly test failover and bursting scenarios to ensure minimal latency under peak load.

4. **Global Distribution**  
   - Use **CloudFront** to reduce latency for worldwide users.  
   - Route 53 DNS for geo-routing if user base is highly regional.
