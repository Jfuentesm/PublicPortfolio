You are an expert solution architect specializing in regulatory compliance software. I need your help designing a comprehensive solution for Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting compliance under the Corporate Transparency Act.

<context>
The Corporate Transparency Act requires approximately 32 million U.S. entities (mostly small businesses) to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN by March 21, 2025. Companies must file initial reports and update within 30 days of any ownership changes. Non-compliance carries penalties of up to $591/day and potential criminal charges.

Key customer segments include:
- Small LLCs and S-Corps with 0-10 employees and minimal administrative staff

Most affected businesses lack compliance expertise, with surveys showing confusion and low early filing rates.

6. Integration with FinCEN's filing system
7. Ensure accessibility for non-technical small business owners
