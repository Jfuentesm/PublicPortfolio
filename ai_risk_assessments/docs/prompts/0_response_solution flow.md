# AIRiskAssessment.com Solution Flow and Technical Elements

## Solution Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Upload corporate risk register (Excel/CSV format) containing risk descriptions, categories, and current assessments
   - Upload assessment rubric (Excel/CSV format) defining scoring criteria and thresholds
   - Upload organizational structure (Excel/CSV or JSON format) showing entity relationships

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Validate uploaded files for required fields and format compliance
   - Normalize risk descriptions and categories
   - Sanitize input data (remove sensitive information, standardize formatting)
   - Create a unified data structure linking risks to organizational entities

3. **Risk Assessment Processing**
   - For each risk in the register:
     - Generate research batch with contextual information about the risk
     - Send batch to LLM via API with custom prompt for assessment
     - LLM evaluates risk based on provided rubric criteria
     - If insufficient information, trigger research loop:
       1. Formulate search query based on risk description and context
       2. Send query to research API (Tavily)
       3. Process research results
       4. Generate assessment with research evidence

4. **Assessment Validation**
   - Validate LLM responses against rubric requirements using Pydantic models
   - Check for assessment completeness and consistency
   - Flag anomalies or inconsistencies for review
   - Resend failed assessments with additional context

5. **Output Generation**
   - Compile all risk assessments into structured format
   - Generate comprehensive risk assessment report (Excel/PDF)
   - Create executive summary highlighting critical risks
   - Store results securely for client download

6. **Delivery & Notification**
   - Make results available for download via secure link
   - Send email notification when assessment is complete
   - Include usage statistics for billing purposes

## Technical Elements

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI framework
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Azure OpenAI (for primary risk assessment)
  - Tavily API (for supplementary research)
- **Validation**: Pydantic models
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (for secure file storage)

### Data Models
- **Risk Record**: Pydantic model for individual risks
- **Assessment Rubric**: Pydantic model defining evaluation criteria
- **Organizational Structure**: Graph-based representation of entity relationships
- **Assessment Output**: Structured format including risk scores, recommendations, and sources

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker containers orchestrated via AWS ECS
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL (minimal, storing only processing metadata)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 with encrypted buckets
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for user management

### Security Measures
- **Data Sanitization**: Pre-processing to remove sensitive information
- **Field Validation**: Strict validation of input data fields
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption for all stored data
- **Access Control**: Time-limited access tokens for result retrieval
- **Data Retention**: Automatic deletion of source data after processing

### User Interface
- **Simple Web Interface**:
  - File upload capability with validation
  - Progress tracking during assessment
  - Secure download of results
  - No complex exploration features
- **Notification System**:
  - Email alerts for process completion
  - Status updates during long-running assessments

### Monitoring and Billing
- **Usage Tracking**:
  - LLM token consumption (input/output)
  - API calls to research services
  - Processing time metrics
- **Logging**:
  - Comprehensive processing logs
  - Error tracking and reporting
  - Audit trail for compliance purposes

## Processing Workflow Detail

1. **Risk Register Processing**:
   - Parse risk descriptions
   - Extract key risk attributes (category, potential impact, likelihood)
   - Group similar risks for batch processing

2. **Rubric Application**:
   - Convert qualitative rubric to quantitative scoring system
   - Create prompt templates incorporating rubric criteria
   - Define validation rules based on rubric requirements

3. **Assessment Generation**:
   - For each risk batch:
     - Generate contextual prompt with organizational context
     - Request LLM assessment with structured JSON output format
     - Validate response structure and completeness
     - Extract evidence and confidence scores

4. **Research Enhancement**:
   - For risks with low confidence or incomplete assessment:
     - Generate targeted search queries
     - Process search results to extract relevant information
     - Re-assess with additional context
     - Document sources in final output

5. **Output Compilation**:
   - Merge all assessments into standardized format
   - Generate summary statistics and key findings
   - Create downloadable report with evidence links
   - Archive processing logs for audit purposes
