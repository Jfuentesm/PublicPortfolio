Okay, here is the complete, updated design document for AIRiskAssessment.com, incorporating AI-driven risk generation, a robust UI, mitigation planning, action tracking, and hierarchical reporting.

**AIRiskAssessment.com: SaaS Platform Design**

**1. Core Concept & Goal:**

AIRiskAssessment.com is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to empower Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to proactively identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate, and monitor corporate risks. Leveraging AI for suggestion and assessment, combined with an intuitive user interface for collaboration and action tracking, the platform aims to provide accessible, affordable, and effective enterprise-grade risk management capabilities.

**2. High-Level User Flow:**

1.  **Onboarding & Profile Setup:**
    *   User registers/logs in via a secure authentication provider (e.g., AWS Cognito).
    *   User completes a detailed **Company Profile** via the UI (Industry, Size, Geography, Key Operations, Technologies, Strategic Goals, Compliance Requirements, etc.). This profile is persistently stored and used as context for AI.
    *   User uploads/defines their **Organizational Structure** (Departments, Roles, Users, Reporting Lines â€“ graph or structured list). This is used for assignments and hierarchical reporting.
    *   User uploads, selects from templates, or defines their **Assessment Rubric** (Likelihood scales, Impact scales, criteria definitions, risk scoring matrix/thresholds).

2.  **Risk Identification & Register Building (Interactive Module):**
    *   User navigates to the "Identify Risks" module.
    *   **AI Suggestion Engine (Backend Trigger):**
        *   Processes the Company Profile and Org Structure.
        *   **Library Matching:** Queries an internal, curated `Risk Library` based on profile tags (industry, operations, geography, etc.) to suggest relevant *standard* risks.
        *   **Generative AI:** Uses an LLM (e.g., Azure OpenAI), prompted with the Company Profile, Org Structure context, and a predefined `Risk Taxonomy` (e.g., Strategic, Financial, Operational, Cyber, Compliance, Legal, Reputational), to brainstorm *company-specific* potential risks within each category.
    *   **UI Review & Curation:** Presents a consolidated list of *suggested* risks (library + AI-generated). The user can:
        *   Review details, relevance scores, and sources (library/AI).
        *   Accept, reject, or edit suggested risks (description, category, owner suggestion).
        *   Manually add custom risks.
    *   **Confirmation:** User finalizes the list, creating the versioned `Corporate Risk Register` for the period, which is stored persistently.

3.  **Risk Assessment Initiation:**
    *   User navigates to the "Assess Risks" module.
    *   Selects the `Risk Register` version and the `Assessment Rubric` to use.
    *   Initiates the assessment process (triggers an asynchronous backend job).

4.  **Automated Assessment & Research (Backend Process):**
    *   Backend job iterates through each risk in the selected `Risk Register`.
    *   **For each Risk:**
        *   Generates a contextual prompt including risk details, rubric criteria, and org context.
        *   Performs optional initial targeted research (e.g., Tavily API) based on risk description for external context.
        *   Sends enriched prompt to LLM (Azure OpenAI) requesting structured assessment (score components, justification, confidence, data gaps).
        *   Parses and validates the LLM response using Pydantic models.
        *   If confidence is low or assessment incomplete, triggers a supplementary research loop (Tavily -> Refine Prompt -> LLM).
        *   Logs LLM/API usage.
        *   Stores the *draft* assessment result (scores, justification, research evidence links, AI confidence) persistently, linked to the specific risk and assessment run ID.

5.  **Review, Refine & Prioritize Assessments (Interactive Module):**
    *   User receives notification (UI/Email) upon assessment job completion.
    *   Navigates to the "Assessment Results / Risk Dashboard".
    *   **Interactive Dashboard:** Displays key metrics (risk heatmap, overall score, top risks by score/category, trends vs. previous assessments).
    *   **Detailed Results Table/View:** Allows filtering and sorting. User can drill down into individual risks:
        *   View AI-generated draft assessment details.
        *   **User Override:** Allows users (with appropriate permissions) to manually adjust AI-generated likelihood/impact scores, requiring justification for the change. The system stores both AI and final user-adjusted scores.
        *   Add qualitative comments or internal notes.
    *   **Prioritization:** Based on final (potentially user-adjusted) scores and rubric thresholds, the system highlights or allows users to explicitly flag risks requiring mitigation action.

6.  **Mitigation Planning & Action (Interactive Module):**
    *   User navigates to the "Mitigation Actions" module or accesses actions directly from prioritized risks on the dashboard/results table.
    *   For each prioritized risk:
        *   Assign/confirm a primary **Risk Owner** from the defined Org Structure.
        *   Initiate the **"Create Mitigation Plan" Sub-flow** (See Section 3.1).
        *   Once a plan is defined and approved (if required), initiate the **"Implement Mitigation Plan" Sub-flow** (See Section 3.2).

7.  **Monitoring, Reporting & Governance (Interactive Module & Ongoing Value):**
    *   **Central Dashboard:** Holistic view integrating risk assessment status, mitigation plan progress (on track, delayed, completed), overdue tasks, and overall risk posture trends. Filterable by department/risk category/owner.
    *   **Mitigation Tracking View:** Detailed list of all active mitigation plans and tasks, showing status, owners, due dates, and progress updates.
    *   **Hierarchical Reporting:** Role-based views and downloadable reports:
        *   *Task Owners:* Personal task list with details and update capabilities.
        *   *Risk Owners:* Dashboard of assigned risks, associated mitigation plans, and task statuses.
        *   *Managers/Department Heads:* Aggregated view of risks and mitigation progress within their area(s), exception reports.
        *   *Executives/Directors:* Enterprise-level risk posture, top risks dashboard, alignment with strategic goals, trend analysis, effectiveness summaries.
        *   *Board Level:* High-level, concise reports on critical risks, overall program health, major exceptions, Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), and assurance statements.
    *   **Generate Reports:** Flexible reporting engine to create custom or template-based downloadable reports (PDF, Excel) covering assessments, mitigation plans, status, audit trails, and historical data.
    *   **Historical Analysis:** Visualize risk score changes over time, correlated with mitigation efforts and external events (if logged). Audit trail of changes.
