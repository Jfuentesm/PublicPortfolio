<context> Iâ€™m a strategy consultant. I now have access to advanced coding LLMs. I have developed a few Python apps that embed LLMs for analytical tasks. I have also started to work with RAG Iinluding knowledge graph. I now have 20 weeks where I can devote one hour per day to learn new dev skills. I need to learn through projects.

Below are 3 examples of Apps I have built.

<task>
Help me plan these 20 weeks, focus on pure strategy projects, not ESG. We must be able to complete with free, public data
</task>

<what I have built>
Consider the following technical capabilities:
- Python-based development
- LLM integration & prompt engineering
- Knowledge graph implementation
- RAG systems (including internet search with Tavily)
- UI development with Streamlit (I hate UIs in general)
- Ontology management (basic)

Focus areas should include but not be limited to:
- Regulatory compliance automation
- Sustainability risk assessment
- ESG data analysis and reporting
- Value chain optimization
- Impact measurement and management
