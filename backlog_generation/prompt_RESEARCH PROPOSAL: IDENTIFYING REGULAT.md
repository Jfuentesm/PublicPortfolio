# RESEARCH PROPOSAL: IDENTIFYING REGULATORY-DRIVEN SOFTWARE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE POST-2024 U.S. POLICY LANDSCAPE

## Background
Our company has developed expertise in regulatory compliance SaaS solutions, specifically helping smaller companies manage sustainability risk assessment reporting obligations. Recent political shifts—including the Trump administration's deregulation agenda and the EU's omnibus legislation—have reduced demand in our current market. We need to pivot by identifying new opportunities where businesses require software solutions to address emerging regulatory compliance needs or adopt new IT systems in response policy changes. This SAAS will need to be relatively standalone, we don't have the capacity to do custom integrations into the existing customer systems. We target smaller businesses.

#### Executive Summary
This research will systematically identify and evaluate high-potential business opportunities created by recent regulatory shifts, focusing on new reporting requirements and new IT system needs across industries.

## Research Objectives
1. **Identify and categorize emerging regulatory-driven business opportunities:**
   - **New reporting obligations** being introduced that require specialized software solutions
   - **Policy changes** necessitating significant IT system adaptations by businesses
   - **Compliance verification requirements** that could be streamlined through technology

2. **Evaluate and prioritize opportunities based on:**
   - Market size (number of affected businesses) and growth potential
   - Urgency of need (compliance deadlines and penalties)
   - Competitive landscape and barriers to entry

3. **Develop detailed profiles of the top 5 highest-potential opportunities**

## Key Areas to Investigate

#### Category 1: New Reporting Obligations


#### Category 2: IT System Adaptation Requirements

## Research Methodology

#### Data Collection
1. **Regulatory Documentation Analysis**
   - Review all Executive Orders issued since January 20, 2025
   - Analyze Federal Register notices and planned rulemakings
   - Track announcements from key regulatory agencies (SEC, EPA, DOL, DHS, Treasury)
   - Examine Project 2025 proposals that may be implemented

2. **Industry Impact Assessment**
   - Analyze industry association publications and guidance documents
   - Review business media coverage of regulatory impacts
   - Identify industry sectors facing the most significant adaptation challenges

3. **Market Analysis**
   - Estimate number of affected businesses by size and industry
   - Analyze current technology solutions addressing similar needs
   - Evaluate willingness-to-pay based on compliance costs and penalties

#### Evaluation Framework
1. **Opportunity Scoring Methodology**
   - Market size (1-10): Number of potential customers × average contract value
   - Urgency (1-10): Based on compliance deadlines and penalty severity
   - Technical feasibility (1-10): Alignment with our current capabilities
   - Competitive advantage (1-10): Assessment of existing solutions and barriers to entry
   - Total opportunity score (4-40): Weighted average of all factors


## Deliverables

#### 1. Comprehensive Opportunity Analysis
- Ranked list of identified opportunities across both categories
- Market size and growth projections for each opportunity


#### 2. Top 5 Opportunity Profiles
Each profile will include:
- Detailed description of the specific regulatory requirements
- Implementation timelines and compliance deadlines
- Target customer segments with firmographic data
- Required product features and technical specifications


## Success Criteria
This research will be deemed successful if it:
1. Identifies at least 10 distinct regulatory-driven software opportunities
2. Provides actionable intelligence on the top 5 opportunities
3. Enables leadership to make an informed decision on market entry strategy
