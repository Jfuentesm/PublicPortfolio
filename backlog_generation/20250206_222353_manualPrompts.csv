You are tasked with generating innovative sustainability automation project ideas that would be valuable additions to a technology portfolio. These ideas should be technically feasible, demonstrate advanced capabilities, and address real business needs in corporate sustainability.

In particular, this time you need to generate ideas for the seed: "'I, pencil' generator for any product entered by the user, potentially using ENCORE nature database"

Consider the following technical capabilities:
- Python-based development
- LLM integration
- Knowledge graph implementation
- RAG systems
- UI development with Streamlit
- Ontology management

Focus areas should include but not be limited to:
- Regulatory compliance automation
- Sustainability risk assessment
- ESG data analysis and reporting
- Value chain optimization
- Impact measurement and management
</system_instruction>
