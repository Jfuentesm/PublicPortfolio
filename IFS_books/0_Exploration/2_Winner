#### Theme Overview
This gentle, emotionally validating picture book introduces toddlers (ages 2-4) to the concept of a new sibling joining the family. Using the Internal Family Systems (IFS) approach, it highlights the different emotions ("parts") a child might feel—joy, sadness, fear, curiosity, jealousy—each personified as friendly animals. The story emphasizes that every feeling is welcome, valid, and can coexist. Through rhythmic language, sensory details, and predictable patterns, young children are guided toward self-compassion, emotional awareness, and understanding of their inner experiences, reassuring them that they are always loved and important.

#### Parent's Guide

**Understanding the IFS Framework**  
- This story uses Internal Family Systems (IFS), a gentle therapy model that sees emotions as "parts" of us, each with important roles.  
- Like Leo, children have many feelings. IFS teaches us to welcome and accept all feelings without judgment.  
- Parents can help children learn emotional awareness, self-compassion, and healthy coping skills through this approach.

**Discussion Points**  
- After reading, ask gentle questions: "Do you ever feel butterflies or bears inside?"  
- Remind your child all feelings are okay: "It's okay to feel sad, excited, or grumpy sometimes."  
- Reinforce you are always there: "Mommy and Daddy are here to help you with all your feelings."

**Extension Activities**  
- **Animal Feelings Puppets:** Create simple puppets for butterflies, turtles, bunnies, and bears. Act out feelings together.  
- **Body Awareness Activity:** When your child has a strong emotion, ask gently, "Where do you feel that in your body?" Encourage deep breaths.  
- **Feelings Box:** Decorate a small box together. When big feelings arise, write them down or draw them, and place them gently into the box, modeling validation and acceptance.

Through this gentle story and these activities, you help your child navigate complex feelings associated with family changes, fostering emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and resilience.
