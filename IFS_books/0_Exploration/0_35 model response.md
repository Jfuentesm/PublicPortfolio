# Message to Parents

Dear Parents,

This book introduces Internal Family Systems (IFS) concepts to help your toddler navigate the significant transition of welcoming a new sibling. By acknowledging and validating the different "parts" of your child's emotional experience, you help them develop emotional intelligence and self-acceptance.

Key points to remember:
- All emotions are valid and welcome
- Help your child name and identify their different "parts"
- Acknowledge both challenging and positive feelings
- Remind them that having multiple feelings is natural and healthy
- Use this book as a starting point for ongoing conversations about emotions
- Create safe spaces for all parts to be expressed

Remember that this transition is a journey, and your child's parts may need different kinds of attention and validation at different times. By modeling acceptance of all emotions, you help your child develop a healthy relationship with their full emotional experience.

Consider reading this book both in calm moments and when big feelings arise, using it as a tool to help your child identify and express which "parts" are present in any given moment.
