# Message to Parents
Dear Parents,  
This book is designed to gently introduce your toddler to the emotional complexity of welcoming a new sibling. Through the lens of Internal Family Systems (IFS), each emotion ("part") your child experiences—happy, worried, sad, playful, jealous, helpful—is acknowledged, validated, and welcomed with warmth and compassion. 

By reading this book together, you encourage your child to recognize and embrace their inner world, reassuring them that all their feelings are normal, healthy, and deserving of care and attention. This approach can foster emotional intelligence, resilience, and a secure sense of self-worth during this significant family transition.

Remember, acknowledging and validating each part helps your child feel seen, safe, and deeply loved.
