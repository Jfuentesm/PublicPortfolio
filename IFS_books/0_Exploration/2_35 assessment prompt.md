# prompt creation

<goal>
our goal is to create the perfect prompt to assess the response of different AI models to the original_prompt below. The focus should be on the quality of the response, not on the quantity of the response. Specially important is how helpful it would be for the parent and for the toddler readers to understand and accept the internal emotional landscape of a toddler going through the situation described. This book is anchored in Internal Family Systems IFS.
</goal>

<output instructions>
craft the perfect assessment prompt, using all your knowledge of prompt engineering. Use XML tags to delineate internal sections of the prompt, and an explicit structured markdown format for the output. We need the prompt to give us a complete assessment of the different responses and a clear recommendation of the best response.
