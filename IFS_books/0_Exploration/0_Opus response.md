Hi, I'm Liam! We have a new baby at home. Sometimes I feel excited, but other times I feel sad or mad. Mom and Dad say all my feelings are okay.

This is my Excited Part. It thinks the baby is cute and can't wait to play with her when she's bigger. My Excited Part makes me smile and giggle around the baby.

## Message  
I also have a Sad Part. It misses when I had Mom and Dad all to myself. This part needs extra cuddles sometimes. Mom and Dad comfort my Sad Part and say they still love me just as much.

Then there's my Angry Part. It comes out when the baby is loud or smelly. My Angry Part wants to yell. Instead, I tell it we can stomp our feet or punch a pillow. Letting my Angry Part out safely helps it feel better.
## Illustration

Sometimes I feel Scared that Mom and Dad love the baby more than me now. When I talk about my Scared Part, they hug me tight and promise they will always love us both the same.

The more I share my parts, the less scary they feel. I'm learning it's normal to have so many feelings about my baby sister. Talking about them helps me feel better.

As time goes by, my Excited Part is around more and more. I'm getting used to being a big brother. It's kind of fun! I'm proud of my new role.

I know it's okay if my other parts still come to visit sometimes. I can always talk to Mom and Dad about my feelings. All my parts are allowed to be here.

I'm learning and growing, just like my baby sister. I know Mom and Dad are here for me and all my parts as we go through this change together. I'm going to be the best big brother ever!

# Message to Parents  
Welcoming a new baby is a big transition for the whole family, especially older siblings. Using the Internal Family Systems model, this book helps you validate and make space for the full range of emotions your older child may experience. By personifying their different feelings as "parts", you can help your child express and accept all the aspects of themselves during this change. Regularly checking in with your older child, listening openly to their parts, and offering plenty of reassurance and one-on-one time can ease their adjustment. Remember, all of their feelings are welcome, and being able to share them openly will help your older child feel secure, adapt to their new role, and develop a loving bond with their new sibling.
