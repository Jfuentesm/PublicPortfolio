#### Parent's Guide

**Understanding the IFS Framework**  
Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a gentle therapeutic model that helps us see emotions as "parts" within us. It is often easy for young children to understand emotions as separate characters. By naming and validating these parts, we help children feel secure, understood, and compassionate toward themselves. This story supports your child in exploring internal feelings safely and lovingly.

**Discussion Points**  
- Encourage your child: "Do you ever feel butterflies or turtles inside? Tell me about them."  
- Remind your child that all feelings are welcome: "It's okay to have many different feelings. Mommy and Daddy have them too."  
- Reinforce your unconditional support: "You are always loved, no matter what feelings visit."

**Extension Activities**  
- **Feelings Puppets:** Craft simple puppets representing butterflies, turtles, bunnies, and bears. Act out feelings together.  
- **Emotion Dance:** Play gentle music and explore different feelings through movement. Ask your child, "How does your bear stomp? How do your butterflies dance?"  
- **Body Awareness Game:** Gently ask your child, "Where do you feel butterflies (or bunnies, etc.)?" Invite simple breathing or cuddling a favorite stuffed animal to help feelings settle.

Through this loving story and these supportive activities, you help your child build emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and inner compassion, creating a solid foundation for lifelong emotional health.
